Serverless GPS tracking and alerting system based on AWS API Gateway, Lambda and Amazon Connect.

A summer project I have built:

Targets: Create a non-expensive solution that helps track my kids in public spaces like public parks, shopping centres.

The system must be serverless, use opendata and multi-device (Accept GPS signal from multiple inputs: mobile phones, GPS devices,
in NMEA or other formats and IoT devices).

It must alert me if the distance between me and them is bigger than X (configurable) meters.

The system must be used for other applications: tracking health patients, schools , pets, fleets, etc..
